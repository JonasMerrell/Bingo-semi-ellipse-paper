Finite elements, while provide accurate stress intensity factor calculations, however, have a high computation cost. Handbook solutions can be used to quickly estimate stress intensity factors. A The Raju Newman equations are a commonly used set of handbook solutions. This work uses genetic programming for symbolic regression to automate the creation of handbook solutions. This research uses a mechanics bases approach to breaking down the stress intensity factor solutions into multiple explainable functions. Using this method allows for the genetic programming based symbolic regression models to outperform the Raju and Newman equations as well as black box models in both accuracy and evaluation time. 

Finite elements offer precise stress intensity factor calculations but come with a significant computational cost. In contrast, handbook solutions, such as the well-known Raju Newman equations, provide a quicker estimation of stress intensity factors. This study employs genetic programming for symbolic regression to automate the generation of handbook solutions.
