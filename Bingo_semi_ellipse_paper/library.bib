   abstract = {In the present study the problem of calculation of the stress intensity factors (SIF) of semi-elliptical cracks located in the stress concentration areas of a pressure vessel is numerically solved by advanced global-local finite element (FE) analysis. The common characteristic of the cases solved is that the stress field at the crack area varies along the axial, the circumferential, as well as, the through-the-thickness directions. SIF solutions for such problems are not available, neither analytically, nor numerically, as the currently existing solutions in the literature (numerical results, Newman-Raju empirical equations, weight function solutions, etc.) are only valid for uniform stress distribution along the axial and circumferential directions of the pressure vessel and allow variation only through-the-thickness. The crack locations considered are the intersection of the cylinder to a nozzle and the connection of the cylinder with its hemi-spherical ends. The stress intensity factors are presented in a suitable table format for various geometrical configurations of both the pressure vessel and the semi-elliptical crack, thus providing a useful tool for the fracture mechanics design of cracked pressure vessels. The modeling details of the sub-structuring methodology, employed in the analysis, are extensively discussed and the numerical approach is proven to be very efficient for the SIF calculation of pressure vessel semi-elliptical cracks. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Newman-Raju solution for a surface cracked plate under uniform tension has been widely used in surface crack-related problems. However, comparisons of Newman-Raju solution with numerical stress intensity factor (K I ) solutions indicated the accuracy of Newman-Raju solution at the depth point inferior to that at the surface point. Therefore, we feel there is a need to improve the accuracy of Newman-Raju solution. With the domain integral method provided by Abaqus, numerical K I solutions with high accuracy were obtained for a wide range of surface crack configurations. By fitting assumed functions to the numerical results, a K I expression was developed for a surface cracked finite plate subjected to uniform tension. The proposed expression can be used to determine K I at an arbitrary point on the crack front. A detailed analysis was conducted on the accuracy of the K I expression, with two application ranges respectively allowing for accuracy better than 3% and 5% provided. The K I expression yields better accuracy than Newman-Raju solution within the application ranges that cover most surface crack configurations occurring in practice, and the accuracy of Newman-Raju solution at the crack depth point has been substantially improved.},

   abstract = {A method for the detection of a single or multiple straight cracks in finite and semi-infinite plane structures is presented. This allows both the identification of crack parameters such as length, position, and inclination angles with respect to a reference coordinate system and the calculation of stress intensity factors (SIFs). The method is based on strains measured at different locations on the surface of a structure and the application of the dislocation technique of linear elasticity. Cracks and boundaries are modelled by continuous distributions of dislocation densities. This approach gives a set of singular integral equations with Cauchy kernels, which are solved using Gauss–Chebyshev numerical quadrature, and, in contrast to e.g. a finite element calculation, spares a discretization of the structure. Once knowing the dislocation densities, the strain at an arbitrary point can be calculated. The crack parameters as well as external loads are determined by solving the inverse problem with a genetic and a simulated annealing algorithm. Once knowing loading and crack parameters, the SIFs are subsequently calculated. With the presented approach, the unknown parameters can be determined very accurately, being aware of some restrictions, which are thoroughly investigated.},

   abstract = {The relationships between the fatigue crack growth rate (da/dN) and stress intensity factor range (δK) are not always linear even in the Paris region. The stress ratio effects on fatigue crack growth rate are diverse in different materials. However, most existing fatigue crack growth models cannot handle these nonlinearities appropriately. The machine learning method provides a flexible approach to the modeling of fatigue crack growth because of its excellent nonlinear approximation and multivariable learning ability. In this paper, a fatigue crack growth calculation method is proposed based on three different machine learning algorithms (MLAs): extreme learning machine (ELM), radial basis function network (RBFN) and genetic algorithms optimized back propagation network (GABP). The MLA based method is validated using testing data of different materials. The three MLAs are compared with each other as well as the classical two-parameter model (K* approach). The results show that the predictions of MLAs are superior to those of K* approach in accuracy and effectiveness, and the ELM based algorithms show overall the best agreement with the experimental data out of the three MLAs, for its global optimization and extrapolation ability.},

   abstract = {Brittle porous materials are used in many applications, such as molten metal filter, battery, fuel cell, catalyst, membrane, and insulator. The porous structure of these materials causes variations in their fracture strength that is known as the mechanical reliability problem. Despite the importance of brittle porous materials, the origin of the strength variations is still unclear. The current study presents a machine learning approach to characterize the stochastic fracture of porous ceramics and glasses. A combined finite element modeling and fracture mechanics approach was used to generate a unique empirical data set consisting of normalized stress intensity factors (nSIFs, KI/σ∞ = Yπa) that define fracture strength of brittle systems under uniaxial tensile loading and biaxial tensile loading. These empirical data sets were used to generate prediction functions and validate their accuracy. Monte Carlo simulations with two machine learning algorithms, random forests (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANN), were used to simultaneously determine the optimum percentages for the training and test data set split and the prediction function validation. The constraint was taken to be the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) during the process. In the implementation step, new porous media with uniformly distributed pores were created and the prediction functions were used to obtain nSIFs and characterize the media. As a novelty of this approach, which ensures the predictive characterization of the generated media, a geometric matching method by means of the Euclidean bipartite matching between the empirical and the generated media was presented and the nSIFs were compared by means of MAPE. As a result of the study, MAPE ranges are 3.4–17.93% (uniaxial load) and 2.83–19.42% (biaxial load) for RF, 3.79–17.43% and 3.39–21.43 for ANN at the validation step; 3.54–18.20% (uniaxial load) and 3.06–21.60% (biaxial load) for RF, 3.57–18.26% and 3.43–21.76% for ANN at the implementation step. The proposed approach can be thus used as a predictive characterization tool, especially for the analysis and Weibull statistics of porous media subjected to brittle failure.},

The mean square error for predicting the FCG of cryo-rolled Al 2014 alloy by BPNN, ELM and curve fitting methods are 1.89, 1.84 and 0.09 respectively. While the ELM models outperform the rest of models in terms of training time, curve fitting model showed best performance in terms of accuracy over testing data with least mean square error (MSE).

The effects, of these input parameters and biaxial load factors, on the statistics of MMSIFs with input individual and combined random system parameters, are analyzed. Also, the stochastic fracture behavior is predicted with the increment in the radius of the hole and with the change in the position of the discontinuities (a hole emanating cracks) in the plate using uncorrelated combined randomness with different input variables. Further, the static crack propagation behavior of the plate with hole emanating cracks under biaxial loading with different biaxiality ratio is analyzed.},

   abstract = {Fatigue cracks commonly occur for in-service engineering structures. The main parameter for fatigue crack is the stress intensity factor (SIF). The SIF is an indicator of the fatigue crack growth and remaining life of a structure. Nonetheless, a problem was raised when determining the remaining life since the SIF could not be presented in physical phenomena. Thus, a technique is required to predict the range of SIF. Maximum and minimum bounds of SIF help estimate the range of remaining life. This paper aims to predict a structure's safe and failure region during the fracture process based on the SIFs. The primary tool is S-version Finite Element Model (S-FEM). Yet, S-FEM unable to compute random variables in analysis. Thus, the Bootstrap is developed and embedded into S-FEM for computing random variables in the analysis. The random variables are utilised to predict a range of SIFs. The SIFs are generated based on one hundred samples. The samples are randomly generated based on the distribution of material properties. A lognormal distribution is used to generate the material properties. The sampling process is computed based on the bootstrap method. The embedded Bootstrap in S-FEM was introduced as BootsrapS-FEM. When the samples exceed the fracture toughness of 29 MPa.√m, the failure region is indicated at the angle 2ϕ/π = 0.627 to 1 with 6% of failure samples. The safe region is observed at angle 2ϕ/π = 0 to 0.626 with 94% of the samples. The failure region is essential in this analysis to prevent unstable crack growth.},

Although traditional experiment and analysis based on fracture theory have been well established and have accumulated considerable data, time consumption and diseconomy are still encountered. To address these challenges, a new data-driven approach based on machine learning is presented. The back propagation neural network is trained and adopted to predict the basic curve da/dN-ΔKeff, i.e., fatigue crack growth rate versus the crack closure-based effective stress intensity factor range, and the fatigue life of surface cracked specimens under constant amplitude cycle loading. The influence of different number of neural units and layers on effectiveness of the trained neural network are investigated, Moreover, the neural network model is compared with other regression models. The test result shows that the trained neural network model is superior to other models and can obtain material data and fatigue life accurately and rapidly. Finally, through the active learning algorithm of query by committee algorithm, we select a small number of samples for training to obtain a model that meets the accuracy. This model can directly bridge the gap between the preliminary detailed stress analysis and the final fatigue life, and greatly reduce the cost of obtaining data sets. This provides a new way to solve engineering problems.},

This paper is the continuation of the earlier work, as it focuses on the experimental validation of the proposed AGPRM. For validation purposes, the values of SIF obtained from experiments available in the literature are used. The experimental validation of AGPRM also consists of the comparison of the prediction accuracy of AGPRM and FEM relative to the experimentally derived SIF values. Five metrics, namely, root-mean-square error (RMSE), average absolute error (AAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), maximum absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2), are used to compare the accuracy. A case study illustrating the development and experimental validation of the AGPRM is presented. Results indicate that the prediction accuracy of AGPRM is comparable with and even higher than FEM, provided the training points of AGPRM are chosen aptly. Good prediction accuracy coupled with less time consumption favors AGPRM as an alternative to FEM for SIF prediction.},

Seventy data points (consisting of load (L), crack depth (a), half crack length (c) and SIF values obtained by FEM) are used to train the aforementioned SMs, while 30 data points are used for testing. In order to compare the accuracy of the SMs, four metrics, namely, rootmean- square error (RMSE), average absolute error (AAE), maximum absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) are used. A case study illustrating the comparison of the prediction capability of various SMs is presented. PYTHON and MATLAB are used to train and test the SMs. Although PR emerged as the best fit, GPR was selected as the best SM for SIF determination due to its capability of calculating the uncertainty related to the prediction values. The aforementioned uncertainty representation is quite valuable, as it is used to adaptively train the GPR model (GPRM), which further improves its prediction accuracy and makes it an accurate, faster, and alternative method to FEM for predicting SIF.},

   abstract = {This paper presents an approach that combines the finite element (FE) modeling and genetic programming (GP) to provide accurate empirical stress intensity factor (SIF) equations for center-cracked steel plates repaired with adhesive-bonded double-sided fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) patches. Several past studies in recent years independently showed that the reduction on the SIF of cracked structures after the patch repair is dependent on many factors such as bonding techniques, material parameters, geometric parameters, environmental factors. In this study, the SIF of the repaired cracked steel plate was considered to be a function of seven parameters including the crack length, elastic modulus of FRP material, shear modulus of adhesive material, dimensions (width, length, and thickness) of rectangular FRP patches, and thickness of adhesive layers. Empirical SIF equations were created by the data mining process of genetic programming analyses performed on a database created from the FE results. The SIF values obtained from these equations were also compared with an analytical equation to assess whether their ability to perform well on a certain design or not. It was found that the proposed SIF equations fitted well with the FE results as the squared Pearson correlation coefficients R2 are higher than 0.9. In addition, the correlations between proposed equations and the analytical equation are approximately 0.8.},

   abstract = {Laboratory test and in-service experience shows fatigue cracks at holes exhibit unsymmetric growth; thus, the need for the new solutions is paramount. Stress intensity factor, K, solutions for symmetric and unsymmetric corner cracks at a hole subject to general loading were determined using a hp-version of the finite element method (FEM) in conjunction with a mathematical splitting scheme to enable efficient, accurate calculations. In traditional applications of the FEM, mesh generation is labor intensive; however, using the splitting scheme, stress intensity functions are obtained without explicitly including the crack in the FE mesh of the global structure. By using the hp-version of FEM, a set of K-solutions converging exponentially fast to the exact solution is obtained. The crack is analyzed in the local domain with easily generated FE meshes. All structurally significant crack shapes were considered; specifically, crack depth to crack length ratios (a/c) of 0.1-10.0, crack depth to sheet thickness ratios (a/t) of 0.10-0.99, and hole radius to sheet thickness ratios (r/t)=1.0. The loading conditions were remote tension, remote bending, and pin loading (bearing). In addition, all combinations of a/c and a/t are analyzed at each side of the hole; thus 226,875 solutions were developed with control of the error in the computed K solutions. Calculated relative error is generally much smaller than 1% along the entire crack front including the vertex regions. Comparisons are made to solutions in the open literature. The new K solutions show the literature solutions are, in general, accurate for all three load conditions; however, for the extreme cases of a/c, a/t, and r/t; the literature solutions differ by as much as 26%. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The corner crack at a fastener hole is, perhaps, one of the most important crack configurations in the aircraft industry. In the late 1970's, Raju and Newman used finite-element analyses to develop crack-tip stress-intensity factor (SIF) solutions for a corner crack at an open circular hole under remote tension and bending loads. Later, equations were developed to give SIF for a practical range of crack configurations. In 2000, Fawaz and Andersson used more advanced finite-element analyses, with nearly an order-of-magnitude more degrees of freedom than those used by Raju and Newman, to generate SIF over a very wide range of crack-configuration parameters. This paper develops improved SIF equations for the case of remote tension, and compares the new equations with the Newman-Raju equations. The original equations were fairly accurate over a wide range in crack configurations, except for very deep cracks. In addition, the paper also demonstrates the impact of using these improved equations on both durability and damage-tolerance analyses. I.

Introduction The development of the field of Fracture Mechanics [1-3] has allowed engineers to predict the growth of cracks in complex structures made of metallic materials. The key parameter was the crack-tip "stress-intensity factor" developed by Irwin [2]. In both the commercial and military aircraft fleets, the use of stress-intensity factors (SIF) has produced more efficient and safer aircraft structures. In particular, the Damage Tolerance design approach has been developed by the U.S. Air Force using the stress-intensity-factor concept [4]. In the aircraft industry, the "corner crack at a fastener hole" is, perhaps, one of the most important crack configurations. Shah [5], Raju and Newman [6] have derived SIF solutions for single-and two-symmetric corner cracks at an open circular hole using the finite-element method (FEM). Later, Newman and Raju [7] developed SIF},

   abstract = {Welded joints are prone to fatigue cracking with the existence of welding defects and bending stress. Fracture mechanics is a useful approach in which the fatigue life of the welded joint can be predicted. The key challenge of such predictions using fracture mechanics is how to accurately calculate the stress intensity factor (SIF). An empirical formula for calculating the SIF of welded joints under bending stress was developed by Baik, Yamada and Ishikawa based on the hybrid method. However, when calculating the SIF of a semi-elliptical crack, this study found that the accuracy of the Baik-Yamada formula was poor when comparing the benchmark results, experimental data and numerical results. The reasons for the reduced accuracy of the Baik-Yamada formula were identified and discussed in this paper. Furthermore, a new correction factor was developed and added to the Baik-Yamada formula by using theoretical analysis and numerical regression. Finally, the predictions using the modified Baik-Yamada formula were compared with the benchmark results, experimental data and numerical results. It was found that the accuracy of the modified Baik-Yamada formula was greatly improved. Therefore, it is proposed that this modified formula is used to conveniently and accurately calculate the SIF of semi-elliptical cracks in welded joints under bending stress.},

The breadth of the length scales naturally enters a more complete material description through the in¯uences that features of the structure of many sizes have on the mechanical responses. The eective inclusion of material structure in simulations is pushing applied plasticity toward more highly quantitative implementations. Computed costs are greater in many respects, but the potential rewards are simulations with much greater relevance to current engineering applications. The focus of this paper is on a number of trends and issues related to these implementations and their use.

Mater. Sci. 16 065007). The focus is on the nucleation event, when a crack extends from within a second-phase particle into a surrounding grain, since this has been observed to be an initiating mechanism for fatigue crack growth in this alloy. It is hypothesized that nucleation can be predicted by computing a non-local nucleation metric near the crack front. The hypothesis is tested by employing a combination of experimentation and finite element modeling in which various slip-based and energy-based nucleation metrics are tested for validity, where each metric is derived from a continuum crystal plasticity formulation. To investigate each metric, a non-local procedure is developed for the calculation of nucleation metrics in the neighborhood of a crack front. Initially, an idealized baseline model consisting of a single grain containing a semi-ellipsoidal surface particle is studied to investigate the dependence of each nucleation metric on lattice orientation, number of load cycles and non-local regularization method. This is followed by a comparison of experimental observations and computational results for microstructural models constructed by replicating the observed microstructural geometry near second-phase particles in fatigue specimens. It is found that orientation strongly influences the direction of slip localization and, as a result, influences the nucleation mechanism. Also, the baseline models, replication models and past experimental observation consistently suggest that a set of particular grain orientations is most likely to nucleate fatigue cracks. It is found that a continuum crystal plasticity model and a non-local nucleation metric can be used to predict the nucleation event in AA 7075-T651. However, nucleation metric threshold values that correspond to various nucleation governing mechanisms must be calibrated. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Ah&raet-A new rate dependent constitutive model is developed for polycrystals subjected to arbitrarily large strains. The model is used to predict deformation textures and large-strain strain hardening behavior following various stress-strain histories for single phase f.c.c. aggregates that deform by crystallographic slip. Examples involving uniaxial and plane strain tension and compression are presented which illustrate how texture influences polycrystalline strain hardening, in particular these examples demonstrate both textural strengthening and softening effects. Input to the model includes the description of single crystal strain hardening and latent hardening along with strain rate sensitivity, all properties described on the individual slip system level. The constitutive formulation used for the individual grains is essentially that developed by Peirce et al. [6, Actu metull. 31, 1951 (1983)] to solve rate dependent boundary value problems for finitely deformed single crystals. Inclusion of rate dependence is shown to overcome the long standing problem of nonuniqueness in the choice. of active slip systems which is inherent in the rate independent theory. Because the slipping rates on all slip systems within each grain are unique in the rate dependent theory, the lattice rotations and thus the textures that develop are unique. In addition, the model makes it Possible to study how strain rate sensitivity on the slip system, and single grain, levels is manifested in polycrystalline strain rate sensitivity. The model is also used to predict "constant offset plastic strain yield surfaces" for materials that are nearly rate insensitive-these calculations describe the development of rounded "yield surface vertices" and the resulting softening of material stiffness to a change in loading path that vertices imply. For our rate dependent solid this reduction in stiffness occurs after small but finite loading increments. Finally the model is used to carry out an imperfection-based sheet necking analysis both for isotropic and strongly textured sheets. The results show that larger strain hardening rates, and strain rate sensitivity, on the slip system kvel both increase the failure strains, as expected, but also demonstrate a strong influence of texture on localized necking.

A 3D full-field formulation based on fast Fourier transforms for the prediction of the viscoplastic deformation of poly-crystals is used with rate-sensitive crystal plasticity. Two measured polycrystalline structures are used to instantiate the simulations, as well as a fully periodic synthetic polycrystal adapted from a simulation of grain growth. Application of (Euclidean) distance maps shows that hot spots in stress tend to occur close to grain boundaries. It is also found that low stress regions lie close to boundaries. The radial distribution function of the hot spots indicates clustering. Despite the lack of texture in the polycrystals, the hot spots are strongly concentrated in 〈1 1 0〉 orientations, which can account for the observed clustering. All three microstructures yield similar results despite significant differences in topology. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {In the present work, we postulate that a critical value of the stored plastic strain energy density (SPSED) is associated with fatigue failure in metals and is independent of the applied load. Unlike the classical approach of estimating the (homogenized) SPSED as the cumulative area enclosed within the macroscopic stress-strain hysteresis loops, we use crystal plasticity finite element simulations to compute the (local) SPSED at each material point within polycrystalline aggregates of a nickel-based superalloy. A Bayesian inference method is used to calibrate the critical SPSED, which is subsequently used to predict fatigue lives at nine different strain ranges, including strain ratios of 0.05 and -1, using nine statistically equivalent microstructures. For each strain range, the predicted lives from all simulated microstructures follow a lognormal distribution. Moreover, for a given strain ratio, the predicted scatter is seen to be increasing with decreasing strain amplitude; this is indicative of the scatter observed in the fatigue experiments. Finally, the lognormal mean lives at each strain range are in good agreement with the experimental evidence. Since the critical SPSED captures the experimental data with reasonable accuracy across various loading regimes, it is hypothesized to be a material property and sufficient to predict the fatigue life.},

   abstract = {Fatigue cracks form and grow in fatigue critical structural alloys that are relevant to Naval aviation applications from nucleant grains, phases, or constituent particles in the high cycle fatigue (HCF) regime. To enable progress in configuring Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) towards addressing improved fleet performance, we present a multilevel scripted ICME workflow that employs microstructure-sensitive simulations. An inductive design exploration framework considers various sources of uncertainty to inform robust decisions regarding materials development necessary to achieve desired performance of fatigue critical components, given accessible process paths and resulting microstructures. Uncertainty propagation through model chains (whether models are surrogates, empirical, or based on simulation) is considered. Digital statistical volume element representations of microstructure are employed, with structure-property relations based on microstructure-sensitive computational fatigue modeling using the crystal plasticity finite element method, addressing sensitivity to microstructure resulting from process path including both intrinsic (grain/phase size, shape and orientation distributions) and extrinsic (residual stresses, surface roughness, nonmetallic inclusions or pores) features. The digital workflow considers extreme value (minimum property) fatigue response as the primary performance requirement. The framework is exercised to explore available microstructures for α-β Ti-6Al-4V. The work has potential to impact development of new and improved fatigue critical material systems relevant to naval applications.},

   abstract = {The stress intensity factor (SIF: K) analysis is of utmost importance in the evaluation of the coal-rock mass damage. However, the existing calculation processes seem cumbersome, even failing to meet the remote real-time determination of the SIF. Against this background, this paper introduces a prediction method of the SIF for the mode-I crack in the coal rock based on deep learning (DL). As soon as the model training is completed, the SIF can be acquired only by inputting the coal-rock image. To obtain extensive images of the mode-I crack of coal rock during the three-point bending test, a high-speed camera is used. The digital image correlation (DIC) and a crack-tracking algorithm (CTA) are further utilized to calculate the SIF corresponding to each image. Afterward, the model is trained and validated based on the self-designed convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The final results demonstrate that the fitting coefficient between the true value and the predicted one reaches 0.961, which indicates that the trained model is able to accurately predict the SIF.},

In this context, this paper develops an automated workflow to assess the fracture mechanism of steel structures directly from inspection images. Firstly, a U-Net is developed to find the pixel-location of a crack. Then, a Gaussian Process surrogate model is trained to predict stress intensity factors, K (indicator for fracture mechanism), for cracks with various dimensions using data from finite element simulations. In the end, by taking the dimensions of identified cracks as input, the trained Gaussian Process is used to estimate the K factors. The proposed workflow empowers an inspector to easily identify steel cracks, predict their propagation from a collection of raw images, and make rapid repair decisions on-site.},

The stress ratio effects on fatigue crack growth rate are diverse in different materials. However, most existing fatigue crack growth models cannot handle these nonlinearities appropriately. The machine learning method provides a flexible approach to the modeling of fatigue crack growth because of its excellent nonlinear approximation and multivariable learning ability. In this paper, a fatigue crack growth calculation method is proposed based on three different machine learning algorithms (MLAs): extreme learning machine (ELM), radial basis function network (RBFN) and genetic algorithms optimized back propagation network (GABP). The MLA based method is validated using testing data of different materials. The three MLAs are compared with each other as well as the classical two-parameter model (K * approach). The results show that the predictions of MLAs are superior to those of K * approach in accuracy and effectiveness, and the ELM based algorithms show overall the best agreement with the experimental data out of the three MLAs, for its global optimization and extrapolation ability.},

Although traditional experiment and analysis based on fracture theory have been well established and have accumulated considerable data, time consumption and diseconomy are still encountered. To address these challenges, a new data-driven approach based on machine learning is presented. The back propagation neural network is trained and adopted to predict the basic curve da/dN-ΔKeff, i.e., fatigue crack growth rate versus the crack closure-based effective stress intensity factor range, and the fatigue life of surface cracked specimens under constant amplitude cycle loading. The influence of different number of neural units and layers on effectiveness of the trained neural network are investigated, Moreover, the neural network model is compared with other regression models. The test result shows that the trained neural network model is superior to other models and can obtain material data and fatigue life accurately and rapidly. Finally, through the active learning algorithm of query by committee algorithm, we select a small number of samples for training to obtain a model that meets the accuracy. This model can directly bridge the gap between the preliminary detailed stress analysis and the final fatigue life, and greatly reduce the cost of obtaining data sets. This provides a new way to solve engineering problems.},

It is pointed out that for somewhat brittle tensile fractures in situations such that a generalized plane-stress or a plane-strain analysis is appropriate, the influence of the test configuration, loads, and crack length upon the stresses near an end of the crack may be expressed in terms of two parameters. One of these is an adjustable uniform stress parallel to the direction of a crack extension. It is shown that the other parameter, called the stress-intensity factor, is proportional to the square root of the force tending to cause crack extension. Both factors have a clear interpretation and field of usefulness in investigations of brittle-fracture mechanics.},

This method improves the accuracy of crack growth prediction by using real crack data to correct the ML model. In the research process, the prediction performance of the three ML methods is compared, and the CGR-ML model for crack growth is established. Subsequently, dynamic correction strategy for the CGR-ML model is proposed while selecting crack detection points by using the nonlinear crack length selection method. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by the central crack growth and the crack growth experiment under mixed-mode multi-step loading. It can be seen from the comparison with the previously proposed fatigue crack growth prediction method based on the theoretical model correction that the method proposed in this paper can achieve a better prediction effect.},

Charpy impact tests were conducted on composites with various combinations of two new bio fillers, pistachio shell powders, and fractal date seed particles, as well as nano-clays and short latania fibers, all which reinforce a poly(propylene)/ethylene–propylene–diene-monomer matrix.

   abstract = {Symbolic regression searches for analytic expressions that accurately describe studied phenomena. The main attraction of this approach is that it returns an interpretable model that can be insightful to users. Historically, the majority of algorithms for symbolic regression have been based on evolutionary algorithms. However, there has been a recent surge of new proposals that instead utilize approaches such as enumeration algorithms, mixed linear integer programming, neural networks, and Bayesian optimization. In order to assess how well these new approaches behave on a set of common challenges often faced in real-world data, we hosted a competition at the 2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference consisting of different synthetic and real-world datasets which were blind to entrants. For the real-world track, we assessed interpretability in a realistic way by using a domain expert to judge the trustworthiness of candidate models.We present an in-depth analysis of the results obtained in this competition, discuss current challenges of symbolic regression algorithms and highlight possible improvements for future competitions.},

   abstract = {A simple and convenient method of analysis for studying two-dimensional mixed-mode crack problems is presented. The analysis is formulated on the basis of conservation laws of elasticity and of fundamental relationships in fracture mechanics. The problem is reduced to the determination of mixed-mode stress-intensity factor solutions in terms of conservation integrals involving known auxiliary solutions. One of the salient features of the present analysis is that the stress-intensity solutions can be determined directly by using information extracted in the far field. Several examples with solutions available in the literature are solved to examine the accuracy and other characteristics of the current approach. This method is demonstrated to be superior in its numerical simplicity and computational efficiency to other approaches. Solutions of more complicated and practical engineering fracture problems dealing with the crack emanating from a circular hole are presented also to illustrate the capacity of this method.},

   abstract = {The problem of a crack in general anisotropic material under LEFM conditions is presented. In Part I, three methods are presented for calculating stress intensity factors for various anisotropic materials in which z = 0 is a plane of symmetry. All of the methods employ the displacement field obtained by means of the finite element method. The first one is known as displacement extrapolation and requires the values of the crack face displacements. The other two are conservative integrals based upon the J-integral. One employs symmetric and asymmetric fields to separate the mode I and II stress intensity factors. The second is the M-integral which also allows for calculation of KI and KII separately. All of these methods were originally presented for isotopic materials. Displacement extrapolation and the M-integral are extended for orthotropic and monoclinic materials, whereas the JI- and JII-integrals are only extended for orthotropic material in which the crack and material directions coincide. Results are obtained by these methods for several problems appearing in the literature. Good to excellent agreement is found in comparison to published values. New results are obtained for several problems. In Part II, the M-integral is extended for more general anisotropies. In these cases, three-dimensional problems must be solved, requiring a three-dimensional M-integral. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@report{Rice1968,
   abstract = {A line integral is exhibited which has the same value for all paths surrounding the tip of a notch in the two-dimensional strain field of an elastic or deformation-type elastic-plastic material. Appropriate integration path choices serve both to relate the integral to the near tip deformations and, in many cases, to permit its direct evaluation. This averaged measure of the near tip field leads to approximate solutions for several strain-concentration problems. Contained perfectly plastic deformation near a crack tip is analyzed for the plane-strain case with the aid of the slip-line theory. Near tip stresses are shown to be significantly elevated by hydrostatic tension, and a strain singularity results varying inversely with distance from the tip in centered fan regions above and below the tip. Approximate estimates are given for the strain intensity, plastic zone size, and crack tip opening displacement, and the important role of large geometry changes in crack blunting is noted. A notlier application leads to a general solution for crack tip separations in the Barenblatt-Dugdale crack model. A proof follows on the equivalence of the Griffith energy balance and cohesive force theories of elastic brittle fracture, and hardening behavior is included in a model for plane-stress yielding. A final application leads to approximate estimates of strain concentrations at smooth-ended notch tips in elastic and elastic-plastic materials.},

   abstract = {A data-driven model is trained to predict mixed-mode stress intensity factors (SIFs) of composites through an artificial neural network (ANN) method. The model is based on a database generated by combining the interaction integral and the extended finite element method (XFEM). To reduce the input dimensionality and improve predictive performance, feature engineering is performed on the input data, and principal component analysis is conducted. Hyperparameters of the model are adjusted by using K-fold cross-validation and Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) to enhance the adaptability and generalization of the model. To overcome the data scarcity issue, an active learning knowledge extraction framework is constructed, which allows for accurate knowledge extraction even with limited data. By utilizing data-driven models to solve mixed-mode SIFs, the computational cost and complexity are greatly reduced compared to numerical simulations, while computational stability and ability to deal with high-dimensional nonlinear problems are significantly improved.},

This solution employs the methodology by Herrmann and co-workers (Herrmann and Sosa, 1986; Kienzler and Herrmann, 1986) that relates notch widening in structural sections to crack advance in the cross-section. Here, we calibrate an additional correction factor using a response surface methodology informed by results from finite element analyses. This approach results in an accurate SIF solution over the design space that is suitable for fatigue crack growth (FCG) analyses. Additional analyses performed in this work show the impact of changing the geometric ratios, loading, and restraint conditions on the SIF solutions.},
