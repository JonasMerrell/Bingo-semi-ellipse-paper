In contrast, handbook solutions, such as the Raju-Newman equations, provide a rapid prediction of stress intensity factors, retaining much of the accuracy from finite elements. This research employs Bingo to automate the generation of handbook solutions. Adopting a mechanics-based approach, the stress intensity factor solution is decomposed into multiple easily understandable functions. This methodology enables the Bingo models to surpass both the Raju-Newman equations and black box models in terms of accuracy and evaluation efficiency.
