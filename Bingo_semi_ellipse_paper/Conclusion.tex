By incorporating knowledge of fracture mechanics into the training process, GPSR is able to create models that can outperform traditional ML methods in both accuracy and explainability. The main limitation of GPSR is its expensive training process. This reduces the number of parameters that can be used making it more difficult to apply to more complex problems. By using the framework proposed here it is possible to create a library of SIF equations for many crack cases that currently have no handbook solutions.
